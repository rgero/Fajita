A custom YouTube wrapper designed to maintain a group video queue during gathering.

**Current Functionality**
- Joining an existing queue
- Switching to a new queue
- Searching for videos
- Adding videos to a queue
- Adding videos to be played next - (skipping a queue)
- Deleting videos from the queue
- Skipping to a different video in the queue
- Play/Pause
- Secretly adding a video to the queue
- Shouting to the room that you added a video
- Opening the currently playing video in YouTube
- Copy the URL of the currently playing video in YouTube

All of these events are being set to a custom backend which sends them to a custom built front end so that we can have a customized viewing experience with our friend groups.

This project is written in Typescript with React.
