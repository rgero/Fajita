A custom YouTube wrapper designed to maintain a group video queue during gathering.

**Current Functionality**
- Joining an existing queue
- Switching to a new queue
- Searching for videos
- Adding videos to a queue
- Adding videos to be played next - (skipping a queue)
- Deleting videos from the queue
- Skipping to a different video in the queue

All of these events are being set to a custom backend which sends them to a custom built front end so that we can have a customized viewing experience with our friend groups.
